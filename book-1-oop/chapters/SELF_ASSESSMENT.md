# What Did You Learn?

Did you complete the project and get all of the code to work? Guess what, that's not important at all. What is important is what you observed and learned during the process.

This is truly a self-assessment, as you will need to reflect on what you learned in this project and collect your thoughts on the following questions. Part of becoming a high-value software developer is understanding key concepts... not just the ability pattern match and write code.

## Object-Oriented Programming Reflection Questions

### 1. **Classes**

- What is the purpose of a class in object-oriented programming (OOP)?
- How does defining a class differ from instantiating an object of that class?
- Can you describe a real-world analogy for classes and objects?

### 2. **Class Constructors**
- What is the role of a class constructor?
- How does the `__init__` method in Python differ from regular methods?

### 3. **Inheritance**
- How does inheritance promote code reusability?
- What is the difference between a base (or parent) class and a derived (or child) class?
- Can you think of a situation where inheritance might not be the best solution?

### 4. **Getters and Setters**
- Why are getters and setters used in OOP?
- How do they promote data encapsulation?
- Can you think of a scenario where direct access to an attribute might be problematic?

### 5. **Composition**
- How does composition differ from inheritance?
- Why might you choose composition over inheritance in certain scenarios?
- Can you provide an example from the project where composition was particularly useful?

### 6. **Multiple Inheritance**

- What challenges might arise from using multiple inheritance?
- Can you think of an alternative to multiple inheritance to achieve similar functionality?
- Explore the Web to find out what the "Mixin" strategy is in Python.

### 7. **Duck Typing**
- How would you explain the phrase "If it looks like a duck, swims like a duck, and quacks like a duck, then it probably is a duck" in the context of programming?
- How does duck typing differ from strict type checking?
- Can you provide an example from the project where duck typing was beneficial?

### 8. **Python Packages**
- Why are packages important in Python programming?
- How do packages help in organizing and modularizing code?
- Can you name a few Python packages you used in the project and explain their purpose?

### 9. **General Reflection**
- Which of these OOP concepts did you find the most challenging and why?
- How did this project change your perspective on designing software?
- Are there any areas you feel you need more practice or clarification on?

### 10. **Application and Future Learning**
- Are there any other OOP concepts or patterns you're curious to learn about?
- How do you think understanding these concepts will benefit you in your software development journey?
