# Implementing POST Capabilities

The initial state of the project supports GET, PUT, and DELETE requests from a client for all three resources.

1. Ships
2. Haulers
3. Docks

It does not support POST to create new rows in any of those database tables. Your team's job is to follow the current patterns of the project's code to implement this feature for all three resources.

There is a `do_POST()` method in the **JSONServer** class for you to work with.

Make sure you methodically use the debugger to inspect the values of your variables as you work on implementing this code.

## Next Steps

Once your team has achieved all [goals for this project](./SS_API_IMPERATIVE_INTRO.md) and documented your observations and conclusions, reach out to an instructor for a comprehensive retrospective and code review. In this retrospective, you will not be focusing specifically on code, but more on higher-order concepts.
