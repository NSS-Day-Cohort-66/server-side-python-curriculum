# Starting your Reader's Digest Django Project

1. In your terminal, go to your **workspace** directory.
2. Create a new directory called **readers-digest**.
3. `cd` to that directory.
4. You are going to run a script that prompts you for a word for your project. When it prompts you, enter the word **digest**.
5. Run the following command in the terminal and enter **digest** when prompted.
   ```sh
   /bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nashville-software-school/course-bash-scripts/main/python/django-setup.sh)"
   ```
6. Once the process completes, run `pipenv shell` to activate the virtual environment that was created for your project.
7. Open the project in Visual Studio Code.
