# Automating Build and Deploy of React App

You are going to set up your Github repository to serve the static, built version of your React app.

> **Special note from your coaches**: Once you make the decision to deploy your client and your API, there are changes that you have to make to ensure that the client will still work. All of your fetch calls must be made to your publicly deployed API, not localhost:8000. Discuss this with one of your coaches when you're ready.

## Repo Configuration

1. Go to your Github repo.
2. Click on **Settings** tab.
3. Click on the **Pages** link on the left.
4. Under the **Build and Deployment** section, choose _Deploy from a branch_ option from the dropdown.
5. In the **Branch** dropdown that appears, choose `gh_pages`.
6. Click **Save**.

## Project Configuration

1. Make sure your are on the `main` branch of your project.
1. In your project directory, create a `.github/workflows` directory.
2. In the `workflows` directory, create a `deploy.yml` file.
3. Add the following content to the file.
   ```yml
   name: Build & deploy

   on:
     push:
       branches:
         - main
     pull_request:
       branches:
         - main

   jobs:
     build:
       name: Build
       runs-on: ubuntu-latest

       steps:
         - name: Checkout code
           uses: actions/checkout@v2

         - name: Install Node.js
           uses: actions/setup-node@v1
           with:
             node-version: 13.x

         - name: Install NPM packages
           run: npm install

         - name: Build project
           run: npm run build

         - name: Upload production-ready build files
           uses: actions/upload-artifact@v2
           with:
             name: production-files
             path: ./build

     deploy:
       name: Deploy
       needs: build
       runs-on: ubuntu-latest
       if: github.ref == 'refs/heads/main'

       steps:
         - name: Download artifact
           uses: actions/download-artifact@v2
           with:
             name: production-files
             path: ./build

         - name: Deploy to gh-pages
           uses: peaceiris/actions-gh-pages@v3
           with:
             github_token: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
             publish_dir: ./build
   ```
1. Open your `package.json` file in your project.
2. Replace the following line
    ```json
    "build": "react-scripts build",
    ```
    with
    ```json
    "build": "CI=false react-scripts build",
    ```
1. Add, commit, and push your main branch to your Github repo.

## Watching the Build

1. Go to your Github repo and click the **Actions** tab.
2. You will see a new process running named the same as your commit message. This process takes a minute or two.
3. When it's done, you will either see a red x - which means the build failed - or a green checkmark - which means the build succeeded and your project has been deployed.
4. If it succeeded, go back to the **Settings** > **Pages** screen and you will a link at the top that looks like this
    ```txt
    Your site is live at https://username.github.io/projectname/
    ```
1. Click on that link and view your deployed project.
