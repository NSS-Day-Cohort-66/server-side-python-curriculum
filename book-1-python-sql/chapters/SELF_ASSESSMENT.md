# Python and SQL Reflections

Did you complete the project and get all of the code to work? Guess what, that's not important at all. What is important is what you observed and learned during the process.

This is truly a self-assessment, as you will need to reflect on what you learned in this project and collect your thoughts on the following questions. Part of becoming a high-value software developer is understanding key concepts... not just the ability pattern match and write code.

## Object-Oriented Programming Reflection Questions

### 1. **Classes**

- What is the purpose of a class in object-oriented programming (OOP)?
- How does defining a class differ from instantiating an object of that class?
- Can you describe a real-world analogy for classes and objects?

### 2. **Class Constructors**
- What is the role of a class constructor?
- How does the `__init__` method in Python differ from regular methods?

### 3. **Python Packages**
- Why are packages important in Python programming?
- How do packages help in organizing and modularizing code?
- Can you name a few Python packages you used in the project and explain their purpose?

### 4. **General Reflection**
- Which of these OOP concepts did you find the most challenging and why?
- How did this project change your perspective on designing software?
- Are there any areas you feel you need more practice or clarification on?

## API Reflections

## `if` Statements

1. Can I construct an `if` statement to make decisions in my code?
2. Do I understand how to use `elif` and `else` in conjunction with `if`?
3. What is the difference between using `==` and `is` / `is not` with an `if` statement?
4. How would I check to see if a dictionary had a key with an `if` statement?

## `for` Loops

1. Can I write a `for` loop to iterate over elements in a list or tuple?

## Functions

1. Am I able to define and call a function in Python?
2. Do I understand the concepts of function arguments and return values?
3. Can I describe the technical difference between a method and a function?
4. What do I need to do to invoke a function that is defined in a different module?

## Modules

1. Can I explain what a Python module is and why it is useful?
2. Do I know how to import and use functions from a module?
3. Which style of coding do I think takes advantage of using more modules - imperative or declarative?

## Lists

1. Can I create, modify, and access elements in a Python list?
2. Do I understand list comprehensions and how to use them?

## Dictionaries

1. If I was asked in an interview to describe a dictionary, what would I say?
2. Am I able to create and manipulate a dictionary in Python?
3. Do I understand how to access and modify values based on keys in a dictionary?

## Objects

1. Do I know the difference between an object and a dictionary in Python?
2. Do I remember from Book 1 how to create objects in Python?
3. Can I invoke a function that is a member of an object? Is it still called a function in this case?
4. What can an object do that a dictionary can't?
5. Can I describe how I can define all of the properties and method for a custom object I want to use in my project?

## Try/Except

1. Can I explain the purpose of a `try/except` block in Python?

## HTTP Response Codes

1. When a server throws an unexpected exception, which status code should I send to the client in the response?
2. If the client requested a supported resource that doesn't exist, what status code should be part of the response meta-data?
3. If the client did not send all of the required data in the payload of the request, what status code should be part of the response meta-data?
4. If the client tries to perform an action _(GET, POST, PUT, or DELETE)_ that isn't supported by the API, what status code should be part of the response meta-data?

## SQL

1. Can I explain what SQL is and why it is used in software development?
2. Is my SQL the database?

## SELECT Single

1. Am I able to write a basic SQL query to select a single record from a database table?
2. Do I understand how to use SQL to retrieve specific columns from a table?

## SELECT Multiple with JOIN

1. Can I construct a SQL query to join two tables and select multiple records?
2. Do I understand the two most common types of joins (INNER and LEFT) and when to use them?

## Filter with WHERE

1. Am I capable of using the `WHERE` clause to filter records in a SQL query?
2. Do I understand how to combine `WHERE` with other SQL clauses like `AND`, `OR`, and `NOT`?
