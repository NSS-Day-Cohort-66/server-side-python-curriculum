## Critters and Croquettes Petting Zoo and Tapas Bar

Lets build some classes for a business that's poised to become the #1 tourist trap in Gatlinburg: Critters and Croquettes Petting Zoo and Tapas Bar. Owner Bobby Andrew Kawlins has big plans for his business, starting with improving how he keeps records of his animals. As the newest member of the dev team at Smoky Mountain Marketing, you want to really get a sense of what your new client needs, so you take a drive to the main strip in Gatlinburg to sit down with Bobby in his office...

> Perched on a hill just down the street from Hillbilly Golf and Ripley's Believe it or Not, Critters and Croquettes Petting Zoo and Tapas Bar smells like new paint and carpet mixed with goats and llamas. Bobby is animated, full of ideas, and excited to have an app that will help him manage his growing empire.

>You get a full tour of the place, from the kitchen churning out small plates of shareable finger foods, to the outdoor corral of friendly four-legged critters looking for a pat on the head and a handful of treats. Bobby also makes sure you get a look at his glass tank crawling with a small collection of snakes, and his goldfish pond -- more of a puddle, really -- where a small school of fish can be seen just under the surface, and a few noisy mallards and Pekings joust for space to paddle in peace.

> "My market research tells me people are crying out for a place where they can eat like hipsters and feed miniature goats at the same time," Bobby tells you. "Right now I have a handful of critters, but the plan is to add more; a lot more. Nobody wants to stand in line to scratch a donkey's ears, you know?"
>
> You nod and smile. "Sounds great," you say. "Sounds like you want to be able to keep records of your current animals, but also be able to add more as you acquire them."
>
> "Exactly!" says Bobby.


Before you begin work on this project, please read the [Object-Oriented Programming in Python](https://realpython.com/python3-object-oriented-programming/). It provides a wonderful, high-level overview of the terms, the syntax and the concepts behind OOP. We also recommend that you bookmark that article for future reference.

After reading the above article, you can practice your Python in the context of learning how to create your own custom types, and learn the basics of inheritance.
