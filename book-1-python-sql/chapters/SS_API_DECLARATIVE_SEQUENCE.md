# Sequence Diagram

Time to get back into practicing your debugger skills. Using the debugger, trace the logical path of the code when a PUT request is sent from the client _(i.e. Postman, Insomnia, etc.)_. There is a feature of a debugger that will be extrmemely helpful, because it shows you the exact signal flow when you use your breakpoints - the call stack.

## Call Stack

In the image below, you will notice that there is a breakpoint on line 36 of the code. By running in debug mode, and using breakpoints, when the code is paused like this, you can see that each module, each function, and the exact line of code is displayed for you.

Watch the following **Debug Python - Call Stack** video for a short introduction to its power in helping a developer understand how to navigate declarative code and quickly jump around to each step in the process.

## Next Step

When your sequence diagram is complete, your team must contact one of your coaches for a review. Once that review is done, and any corrections are made, you can move on to the next chapter.
