# Sequence Diagram

It's likely been a while since you built a sequence diagram, so this chapter will help you get started. The markdown provided is missing _many_ steps. You must identify all of the other participants and note all steps in the algorithm.

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    title Shipping Ships API

    participant Client
    participant Python
    participant JSONServer
    participant Database
    Client->>Python:GET request to "/ships"
    Python->>JSONServer:Run do_GET() method
    JSONServer-->>Client: Here's all yer ships (in JSON format)
```

## Tools

We strongly recommend that you **do not** use a tool like Draw.io to build a sequence diagram. There are better tools that will generate the visual diagram from markdown text.

### Option 1: SequenceDiagram.org

Visit [sequencediagram.org](https://sequencediagram.org/) and start with the following starter directives.

```txt
title Shipping Ships API

participant Client
participant Python
participant JSONServer
participant Database
Client->>Python:GET request to "/ships"
Python->>JSONServer:Run do_GET() method
JSONServer-->>Client: Here's all yer ships (in JSON format)
```

### Option 2: VSCode Mermaid Plugin

1. Go to VS Code's extensions panel and search for _Markdown Preview Mermaid_.
2. Then install the top selection. The creator is Matt Bierner.
3. Create a new file in your project named `DIAGRAM.md`.
4. Put the code block below in the document.
5. Open the VS Code command palette with **Shift+Cmd+P**/**Shift+Ctrl+P** and searching for _preview_.
6. Choose **Markdown: Open Preview to the Side...** from the options that appear.


````sh
```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    title Shipping Ships API

    participant Client
    participant Python
    participant JSONServer
    participant Database
    Client->>Python:GET request to "/ships"
    Python->>JSONServer:Run do_GET() method
    JSONServer-->>Client: Here's all yer ships (in JSON format)

```
````

### Option 3: Mermaid Preview Extension

1. Search for the **Mermaid Preview** extension by Vlad Stirbu and install it.
2. Create a file in your project with a `.mmd` extension.
3. Open the VS Code command palette and run the **_Preview Mermaid_** command.
4. The diagram will be rendered in a new panel to the right.

## Build your diagram

Once your team has chosen which tools will be used, use your debugging skills to build a sequence diagram that correctly visualizes the process for a GET request from a client.

## Next Steps

When your sequence diagram is complete, you must contact one of your coaches for a review. Once that review is done, and any corrections are made, you can move on to the next chapter.
