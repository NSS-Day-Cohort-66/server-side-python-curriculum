# Level Up React Client

You will be building a React client for this project as well since you are a full-stack development student. Go back and look at the README for the **Rock Of Ages** client project, and follow the instructions in the **How This Was Generated** section; make sure you create a directory named `levelup` instead of `rock-client`.

You can copy the following files from **Rock Of Ages** to **Level Up**.

- `pages/Login.css`
- `pages/Login.jsx`
- `pages/Register.jsx`
- `components/Navbar.css`
- `components/Navbar.jsx`

1. Open the **Login** and **Register** components and change the local storage key being used and header above the forms to **Level Up** instead of **Rock of Ages**.
2. Open the **Navbar** component and change the name of the local storage key.
3. In the **Navbar** component, create links for the following actions.
    - Games
    - Events
    - Profile
    - Logout
4. Create your Github repository and make your first commit and push.
