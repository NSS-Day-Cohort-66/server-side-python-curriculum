# Level Up React Client

You are going to start this project with a basic React client for gamers to use to create accounts, register games, schedule events, and join/leave events created by other gamers.

Visit the [Level Up React Template](https://github.com/nashville-software-school/level-up-react-18-template) Github repository and click on the "Use this template" button to generate a repository in your own Github account.

Once the generation process is complete, clone the repository down to a directory of your choosing inside your `~/workspace` directory. Once cloned, start the application and in your browser, you should be able to toggle back and forth between the login and register views, as shown below.
