# A Database Model

Time to create a new ERD for the Honey Rae's Repairs application. This application allows customers to create service tickets for the team at Honey Rae's to work on over time. After a ticket is submitted, an employee can then access the application whenever she wants and assign herself to a ticket.

The **User** table is colored differently because you won't be creating it yourself. Django creates it for you. More on that later.

Create this ERD in your database diagramming tool of choice _(dbdiagram, DrawSQL, etc...)_. If you are using dbdiagram, we provide the syntax below.

Table User [headercolor: #2c3e50] {

  first_name varchar
  last_name varchar
  email varchar
}

Table Customer [headercolor: #f39c12] {
  id int pk
  address varchar
  user_id int [ref: > User.id]
}

Table Employee [headercolor: #f39c12] {
  id int pk
  specialty varchar
  user_id int [ref: > User.id]
}

Table ServiceTicket [headercolor: #f39c12] {
  id int pk
  customer_id int [ref: > Customer.id]
  employee_id int [ref: > Employee.id]
  description varchar
  emergency boolean
  date_completed date
}
```

## Django Models

You are going to design these tables with something called a Model. You are going to make one Model for **Employee** , one for **Customer** and one for **ServiceTicket**.

The reason you removed `name` and `email` from the **Customer** table is because one of the great things about Django is that we automatically get a **User** model created for us that has `name`, and `email` fields on it.

Unfortunately, the **User** model doesn't have `address`, so you have to create a **Customer** model with _just_ `address` to you can capture that information.

### Customer Model

Make the file below and copy pasta the code into it. This is the model that you will interact with, and it has a 1-1 relationship with the user model that lives inside Django.

> #### `honeyrae-server/repairapi/models/customer.py`

```py
from django.db import models
from django.contrib.auth.models import User


class Customer(models.Model):

    # Relationship to the built-in User model which has name and email
    user = models.OneToOneField(User, on_delete=models.CASCADE)
    # Additional address field to capture from the client
    address = models.CharField(max_length=155)

    @property
    def full_name(self):
        return f'{self.user.first_name} {self.user.last_name}'
```

Now that you have a model defined, it needs to be added to your project's models package.

> #### `honeyrae-server/repairapi/models/__init__.py`

```py
from .customer import Customer
```

### Employee Model

Make the file below and copy pasta the code into it.

> #### `honeyrae-server/repairapi/models/employee.py`

```py
from django.db import models
from django.contrib.auth.models import User


class Employee(models.Model):
    user = models.OneToOneField(User, on_delete=models.CASCADE)
    specialty = models.CharField(max_length=155)

    @property
    def full_name(self):
        return f'{self.user.first_name} {self.user.last_name}'
```

Now that you have a model defined, it needs to be added to your project's models package. Add the following code.

> #### `honeyrae-server/repairapi/models/__init__.py`

```py
from .employee import Employee
```

### ServiceTicket Model

Make the file below and copy pasta the code into it. Remember, Python conventions don't use camel casing - for variable names or file names. The only exception is class names _(as you see below)_.

Note that there is a line defining each field that is in the ERD above 👆🏿.

> #### `honeyrae-server/repairapi/models/service_ticket.py`

```py
from django.db import models


class ServiceTicket(models.Model):
    customer = models.ForeignKey("Customer", on_delete=models.CASCADE, related_name='submitted_tickets')
    employee = models.ForeignKey("Employee", null=True, blank=True, on_delete=models.CASCADE, related_name='assigned_tickets')
    description = models.CharField(max_length=155)
    emergency = models.BooleanField(default=False)
    date_completed = models.DateField(null=True, blank=True, auto_now=False, auto_now_add=False)
```

Now that you have a model defined, it needs to be added to your project's models package. Add the following code.

> #### `honeyrae-server/repairapi/models/__init__.py`

```py
from .service_ticket import ServiceTicket
```

## Migration of Models

When your models are done, you can then create a migration to create the tables in your database.

```sh
python3 manage.py makemigrations repairsapi
```

Now that migrations are created, run the following command to execute your migrations and create the tables in your database.

```sh
python3 manage.py migrate
```

## Database Connection

You should now have a `db.sqlite3` file in the project folder. Make a connection to the database with SQLite Explorer to see the tables in the database.
