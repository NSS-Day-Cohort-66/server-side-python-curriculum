# Writing the `create` method
The `create` method will handle the `POST` requests to the resource. In this chapter, we’ll add the `create` method to the `GameView` and `EventView`.

## Create a Game
Before writing the create code, take a look back at the `Game` model. We’ll need values from the client for all of the fields on the model.
Here’s the code to create a game. We’ll break it down next.
```python
def create(self, request):
    """Handle POST operations

    Returns
        Response -- JSON serialized game instance
    """
    gamer = Gamer.objects.get(user=request.auth.user)
    game_type = GameType.objects.get(pk=request.data["game_type"])

    game = Game.objects.create(
        title=request.data["title"],
        maker=request.data["maker"],
        number_of_players=request.data["number_of_players"],
        skill_level=request.data["skill_level"],
        gamer=gamer,
        game_type=game_type
    )
    serializer = GameSerializer(game)
    return Response(serializer.data)
```
Inside the method, the first line of code is getting the user that is logged in. Since all of our Postman or `fetch` requests have the user’s auth token in the headers, the request will get the user object based on that token. From there, we use the `request.auth.user` to get the `Gamer` object based on the user. Here’s the equivalent SQL.

```python
db_cursor.execute("""
select *
from levelupapi_gamer
where user = ?
""", (user,))
```

Next, we retrieve the `GameType` object from the database. We do this to make sure the game type the user is trying to add the new game actually exists in the database.
The data passed in from the client is held in the `request.data` dictionary. Whichever keys are used on the `request.data` must match what the client is passing to the server.

To add the game to the database, we call the `create` ORM method and pass the fields as parameters to the function. Here’s the sql that will run:

```python
db_cursor.execute("""
Insert into levelupapi_game (title, maker, number_of_players, skill_level, gamer_id, game_type_id)
values (?, ?, ?, ?, ?, ?)
""", (request.data["title"], request.data["maker"], request.data["numberOfPlayers"], request.data["skillLevel"], gamer, game_type))
```

After the `create` has finished the `game` variable is now the new game instance, including the new id. That object can be serialized and returned to the client now just like in the `retrieve` method

### Try it in postman
Since we’ve added the `create` method to the view class, the `router` inside of `urls.py` already knows that this will be an acceptable route to hit. All `POST` calls to `http://localhost:8000/games` will now call the `create` method. Open up postman to try it out. Add this game to the request body:
```json
{
    "title": "Codenames",
    "maker": "CGE",
    "number_of_players": 6,
    "skill_level": 3,
    "game_type": 2
}
```

## On Your Own
Add the `create` method to the `EventView`. Take a look at the `Event` model to remember which fields you’ll need to account for. For now, don't add any `attendees` to the event. We'll look at adding that later. By the end, a `POST` request to `http://localhost:8000/events` should add a new event to the database.
