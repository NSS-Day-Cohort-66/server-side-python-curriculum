# Listing Events

## Learning Objectives

* You should be able to describe the purpose of a Django View
* You should be able to explain which View methods are used to respond to a request for all of a resource, or a single resource.
* You should be able to discuss the purpose of a Serializer and how it differs from a View.
* You should be able to describe how the keys in the request body can be accessed to assign values to Python object properties in PUT and POST operations.
* You should be able explain how query string parameters can be accessed in your Python code.
* You should be able to demonstrate how multiple serializers can be used to define which properties should be included when nested JSON data is being sent in the response.

## Preface: Seed the Database

Create the fixture below and then seed the database with the following command

```sh
python3 manage.py loaddata events
```

> #### `levelup/levelupapi/fixtures/events.json`

```json
[
    {
        "model": "levelupapi.event",
        "pk": 1,
        "fields": {
            "organizer": 1,
            "description": "Welcome To at lunch",
            "game": 1,
            "date": "2021-10-04",
            "time": "12:00"
        }
    },
    {
        "model": "levelupapi.event",
        "pk": 2,
        "fields": {
            "organizer": 1,
            "description": "Friday night Settlers and drinks",
            "game": 2,
            "date": "2021-08-14",
            "time": "19:30"
        }
    },
    {
        "model": "levelupapi.event",
        "pk": 3,
        "fields": {
            "organizer": 1,
            "description": "Vale of the Frost King campaign. All weekend.",
            "game": 3,
            "date": "2021-04-20",
            "time": "8:00"
        }
    }
]
```

## Step 1: The Event Model Class

You should already have the **`Event`** model for your application. If not, build it now after looking at the requirements in chapter 2.

## Step 2: The Event ViewSet

Time to write the brains of the operation. The ViewSet will handle GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE requests sent from a client application over the HTTP protocol.

        """
        try:
            event = Event.objects.get(pk=pk)
            event.delete()

            return Response({}, status=status.HTTP_204_NO_CONTENT)

        except Event.DoesNotExist as ex:
            return Response({'message': ex.args[0]}, status=status.HTTP_404_NOT_FOUND)

        except Exception as ex:
            return Response({'message': ex.args[0]}, status=status.HTTP_500_INTERNAL_SERVER_ERROR)

    def list(self, request):
        """Handle GET requests to events resource

        Returns:
            Response -- JSON serialized list of events
        """
        events = Event.objects.all()

        # Support filtering events by game
        game = self.request.query_params.get('gameId', None)
        if game is not None:
            events = events.filter(game__id=game)

        serializer = EventSerializer(
            events, many=True, context={'request': request})
        return Response(serializer.data)
```

## Step 3: The Serializers

The serializer class determines how the Python data should be serialized as JSON to be sent back to the client. Put the following code at the bottom of the same module as above.

You'll immediately notice that there are three serializers defined for this module.

An event has two related entities:

1. An organizer _(a.k.a. a Gamer)_
1. A game

This is your first glimpse into how much control you _can_ have over how your data is serialized into JSON.

You can use _ModelSerializer_ with the depth meta property set to let Django handle the entire serialization process for you, including related entities. You can also choose to use the _ModelSerializer_ to serialize any Python list/object without all the magic.

> #### `levelup/levelupapi/views/event.py`

```py
class EventSerializer(serializers.ModelSerializer):
    """JSON serializer for events"""
    organizer = EventGamerSerializer(many=False)
    game = GameSerializer(many=False)

    class Meta:
        model = Event
        fields = ('id', 'game', 'organizer',
                  'description', 'date', 'time')

class EventUserSerializer(serializers.ModelSerializer):
    """JSON serializer for event organizer's related Django user"""
    class Meta:
        model = User
        fields = ['first_name', 'last_name', 'email']


class EventGamerSerializer(serializers.ModelSerializer):
    """JSON serializer for event organizer"""
    user = EventUserSerializer(many=False)

    class Meta:
        model = Gamer
        fields = ['user']

class GameSerializer(serializers.ModelSerializer):
    """JSON serializer for games"""
    class Meta:
        model = Game
        fields = ('id', 'title', 'maker', 'number_of_players', 'skill_level')
```

## Step 4: The URL

The last step is for the server to specify which URL it will respond to with information about events. In this case, you want to expose a `/events` resource at the end of the base API.

http://localhost:8000/events

and

http://localhost:8000/events/1

If any client submits a GET request to either one of those URLs, you need to clearly state that the **`Events`** ViewSet will handle the request.

Update the following import statement at the top of the urls module.

> #### `levelup/levelup/urls.py`

```py
from levelupapi.views import Games, GameTypes, Events
```

Then, add a new URL mapping to the default router.

> #### `levelup/levelup/urls.py`

```py
router = routers.DefaultRouter(trailing_slash=False)
router.register(r'gametypes', GameTypes, 'gametype')
router.register(r'games', Games, 'game')
router.register(r'events', Events, 'event')
```

## Client Code

You can start off with this starter React code to request and display a list of games from the API.

> #### `src/components/game/EventProvider.js`

```jsx
import React, { useState } from "react"

export const EventContext = React.createContext()

export const EventProvider = (props) => {
    const [ events, setEvents ] = useState([])

    const getEvents = () => {
        return fetch("http://localhost:8000/events", {
            headers:{
                "Authorization": `Token ${localStorage.getItem("lu_token")}`
            }
        })
            .then(response => response.json())
            .then(setEvents)
    }

    return (
        <EventContext.Provider value={{ events, getEvents }} >
            { props.children }
        </EventContext.Provider>
    )
}
```

> #### `src/components/game/EventList.js`

```jsx
import React, { useContext, useEffect } from "react"
import { EventContext } from "./EventProvider.js"

export const EventList = (props) => {
    const { events, getEvents } = useContext(EventContext)

    useEffect(() => {
        getEvents()
    }, [])

    return (
        <article className="events">
            <header className="events__header">
                <h1>Level Up Game Events</h1>
            </header>
            {
                events.map(event => {
                    return <section key={event.id} className="registration">
                        <div className="registration__game">{event.game.title}</div>
                        <div>{event.description}</div>
                        <div>
                            {
                                new Date(event.date).toLocaleDateString("en-US",
                                {
                                    weekday: 'long',
                                    year: 'numeric',
                                    month: 'long',
                                    day: 'numeric'
                                })
                            }
                            @ {event.time}
                        </div>
                    </section>
                })
            }
        </article >
    )
}
```

> #### `src/components/ApplicationViews.js`

```jsx
<EventProvider>
    <Route exact path="/events">
        <EventList />
    </Route>
</EventProvider>
```
