# Deploying with Heroku
Heroku is a cloud platform that lets companies and users build, deliver, monitor and scale apps. It's pretty simple to use for deploying your django application. Best of all, there's a free tier that will work well enough for what you'll need.

**As of Sept. 20th, Video is a little out of date. Run step 8 of the Heroku App Set Up to get around a bug in Django v4**

### 0. Before Starting
1. Make sure you have the `db.sqlite3` in the gitignore and check that it is not in the github repo. If it is on github, fix that first before continuing.
2. Follow the steps in Book 2 Chapter 1 to hide the django `SECRET_KEY` variable.

### 1. Heroku Account Set Up
1. In the terminal, cd to your project folder and create a new branch named `deploy`. Push that branch to github
1. Install heroku cli: https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/getting-started-with-python#set-up
1. Create heroku account. You will want to use two factor authentication (TFA) when creating your account: https://signup.heroku.com/
2. Create application in heroku: https://dashboard.heroku.com/new-app

### 2. Heroku App Set Up
1. After creating the application, go to the "Config Vars" section, click on "Reveal Config Vars"
2. For every key and value pair in the `.env` file add those pairs to the config variables
3. Back in the terminal on the `deploy` branch, there's a few extra packages you'll need to install `pipenv install gunicorn django_on_heroku`. If you're a mac user and that fails, run `brew install postgresql` then rerun the pipenv install
4. Add `import django_on_heroku` to the imports in `settings.py`
5. Add these lines to the end of the `settings.py`
    ```py
    STATIC_ROOT = os.path.join(BASE_DIR, 'staticfiles')
    STATIC_URL = "/static/"
    STATICFILES_STORAGE = 'django.contrib.staticfiles.storage.StaticFilesStorage'

    django_on_heroku.settings(locals())
    ```
6. Add the imports at the top of the settings
    ```py
    import os
    import django_on_heroku
    ```
7. Add a file called `Procfile` to the root directory of your project and paste in this line (change out `levelup` for your project module name) `web: gunicorn levelup.wsgi --log-file -`
8. Add these static files so heroku is happy: `touch rest_framework/css/bootstrap.min.css.map rest_framework/css/bootstrap-theme.min.css.map`
9. Add, commit, and push all the changes to the deploy branch.

### 3. Automatic Deploy Set Up
#### Skip to "Deploy from the Terminal" if you don't want Heroku to have access to your github account
1. After you create the application, click the "Deploy" tab 
2. Then, click on the Github deployment method and log into Github in the pop up window
3. Scroll down a little and click the connect to github button that has appeared.
4. Type in the name of the repo you want to deployand click search.
5. Your repo should appear below the search field. Click the 'Connect' button to connect to the repo.
6. In the Automatic Deployment section, switch the branch from `main` to `deploy` and click "Enable Automatic Deploys". Now the next time anything is pushed to the deploy branch it will kick off a deployment.
7. Since the code was just pushed up, you'll need to trigger a manual deploy. Scroll further down the page to "Manual Deploy" and enter the branch name and click the "Deploy Branch" button.

### 3 (Alt). Deploy from the Terminal
#### Only follow these steps if you skipped "Automatic Deploy Set up"
1. Go to the "Settings" tab in heroku
2. In the "App Information" area at the top of the page there is a "Heroku git URL". Copy that url.
3. In the terminal, add the heroku git url with `git remote and heroku <paste the link>` without the <> characters
4. To push to heroku, use `git push heroku deploy:main`
5. Now, anytime you have changes in the deploy branch, you'll need to run that command to push those changes to heroku

### 4. Django App Set Up
1. Get your app's name from the "Settings" tab in heroku. It should be near the top of the section. You'll need it to run the following commands
2. From the terminal, run `heroku open --app YOUR-APP-NAME` and you should see the base rest framework unauthorized page
3. The next step is checking that a database was created. Run `heroku pg --app YOUR-APP-NAME` and you should see something like this:
![heroku pg output](./images/heroku_pg_output.png)
3. Can't have a django project without tables so run `heroku run python3 manage.py migrate --app YOUR-APP-NAME` The output should look similar to running it locally
4. You'll need to create your django superuser next `heroku run python3 manage.py createsuperuser --app YOUR-APP-NAME` This is a live site so make sure to use a strong password
5. You should notice that all the normal `python3 manage.py .....` commands work as long as `heroku run` is at the beginning of the command.
6. Now to load the fixture data onto your database. **DO NOT LOAD the users.json OR tokens.json!!!!!!!** There is the superuser with an id of 1 so the rest of your fixtures will still work. If you need more users for your fixtures create them in the django admin with the next step.
7. To create a token for the superuser log into `<your-url>.com/admin` with the superuser and click on `Tokens` on the left and add a token for the superuser.
8. Once you are done with development, in the `settings.py` file set `DEBUG` to `False` and push up that change.

### 5. Using Postman

At this point you should be able to use Postman to get data from the database.

Copy the token key you created and add it to the Postman headers:
![postman example headers](./images/postman_ex.png)

Copy the URL heroku gave you into the URL bar and try it out!


### Front end Deployment with Heroku
1. Create a new branch in your project named deploy. `git checkout -b deploy`
2. If you haven't changed your client side fetch urls to hit your new backend make sure you've done this. Also make them https.
3. Add, commit and push any changes and this new branch to your github.
4. Now create the app in the terminal and give it a name (The name may be taken but if it is just run this again with a new name.) `heroku create -b https://github.com/mars/create-react-app-buildpack.git <app-name>`
<!-- TODO: create-react-app-buildpack has been deprecated for heroku versions > 20 find a new way to deploy react frontend -->
6. In the same terminal run `heroku stack:set heroku-20` 
7. Now go to Heroku Profile and click on your new app.
8. To deploy: You can either follow the "Automatic Deploy" or "Deploy from terminal" steps from above for this app.
9. Watch the deployment activity either locally or in heroku for errors
10. Take the heroku url and add it to the `CORS_ORIGIN_WHITELIST` of the server side settings.py file.
11. Add, commit, push, and deploy that change
12. If everything builds correctly go to the app in the browser and check it out
