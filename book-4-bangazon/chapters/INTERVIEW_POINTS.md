# Typical Junior Dev Interview Points

There are several interview techniques that different organization use to interview potential teammates.

## Analytical/Algorithmic Thinking

You will be given a potential feature that needs to be implemented and asked how you would approach it for implementation.

## Syntax Knowledge (trivia/vocabulary)

Sometimes the initial interview is done by a non-technical person to evaluate your basic knowledge of the syntax and vocabulary of the tech stack being used by the team. You will be asked trivia questions about the languages.

For example...

1. What is the difference between a **Set** and an **Array** in JavaScript.
2. Tell me how inheritance works in Python.

## ERDs

You will be given a set of requirements for a database and asked to design an ERD that meets all of the requirements.

## Assess Understanding

You will be given pre-written code, and then after a certain time period, will be asked to explain the purpose of the code, or what its expected output would be. Also, you may be asked to identify bugs or opportunities for improvement.

## Live Coding

This is typically the most anxiety-producing kind of interview. You will be given some basic requirements for a function, module, or system, and then asked to write code to implement the requirements in one of two settings:

1. In a collaborative environment like Code Sandbox where the hiring team is observing and listening to you talk through your thought process and code.
2. You can implement the code on your own time, with no observers, but then asked to explain your code, and answer questions about it in a follow-up meeting.

Schedule a time with your instructors to be interviewed in one of these styles. Your instructional team will let you know the day/time slots that you can pick from.

Be prepared for any one of these styles, or perhaps a mixture of them.

It will be conducted as if we are hiring you, with the hope that you feel more prepared when actual interviews start happening. Your coach will give you feedback about your performance and tips on how to improve.
