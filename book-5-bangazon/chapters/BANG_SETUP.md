# Job Preparation

In this final project, you will be working on an existing app that has already had several sprints worth of work put into it by the development team. There is no group project for book 3 so this is a longer self-assessment. Be prepared to spend at least 3 days on the assessment. When you're ready, reach out to your team lead for the classroom link.

There are still outstanding bugs that need to be fixed, features that need to be added, and tests to be written for the API endpoints. Your job will be the following tasks.

1. Build the remaining Python code to complete implemention of the features.
1. Fix any errors.
1. Fix and failing tests that are currently existing.
1. Implement needed integration tests.
