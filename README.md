# Python

Welcome to the Python and Django course for Nashville Software School.

As an optional primer for this course, you can go through the [Learn Python For Free](https://scrimba.com/course/gpython) course on Scrimba. It's an interactive course that goes through all of the basic syntax of the language.

There's also this tutorial from Microsoft to get started with Python Basics (skip the install chapter and do our install instead): https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/learn/paths/python-first-steps/
