# Your Second API

## Creating the repository

1. Choose one member of your team to create your repository
2. That person will [generate your team's repository](https://github.com/new?template_name=declarative-ships-api&template_owner=nashville-software-school).
3. In the screen that appears, open the **Owner** select menu and choose your cohort's organization.
4. Enter in a creative name for your repository. Make sure the word **declarative** is in the name.
    > Perhaps come up with a fun team name like _Squid Nuggets_ and in the **Repository Name** field enter `squid-nuggets-api-declarative`.
5. Mark the repository as public.
6. Click the **Create repository** button.

## Adding your teammates

Once the repository is created, you need to add your teammates as collaborators.

1. Click the **Settings** tab option at the top.
2. Click the **Collaborators and teams** option on the left.
3. Click the **Add people** button.
4. Enter in a teammates Github handle, and choose them from the search results.
5. Choose **Admin** radio button.
6. Click the **Add person to this repository** button.
7. Repeat steps 3-6 for each teammate.

## Exit Imperative Virtual Environment

If your virtual environment for the last project is still active in your terminal session, you have one of two options:

1. Use the `exit` command in the terminal to close the virtual environment.
2. Open a new terminal window.

## Cloning the repository

1. Everyone on the team can now clone the repository to their `workspace` directory.
2. Once cloned, `cd` to the project directory.
3. Run `pipenv shell` to activate the virtual environment.
4. Run `pipenv install` to install some needed packages.
5. Open the API project with `code .`

## Next Step

Once everyone has the project cloned, it is time to set up everyone's local database.
