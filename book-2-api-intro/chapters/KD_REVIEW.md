# Kneel Diamonds API

Remember Kneel Diamonds? I know it was a long time ago, but you were just learning the basics of how to deal with events in the browser with JavaScript.

Before you build this project, you need to open your ERD and refresh your memory on all of the resources that you defined for the application. There should be four tables.

Three of those tables have data that will never change _(i.e. no new data will be added and none will be modified)_. One of them contains data that is created when the user makes their jewelry choices and clicks the _Purchase_ button in the client.

Keep the ERD open in a browser tab while you build this project so you can always look at it to remember table names and the fields on each one.

Now move on to the next chapter.
