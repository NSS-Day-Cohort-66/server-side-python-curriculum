# Designing Your Own API

> **Reminder:** Your objective is to become an efficient learner, have effective communication, think ananlytically, and think algorithmically. Getting maximum code written for this project is **NOT** your goal.

If you and your teammates choose to be creative and build an API that you dream up, here are the guidelines that you must follow.

1. It must support CRUD operations on 1, or more, features
2. You must implement one or more 1 -> &infin; relationships, and one or more &infin; -> &infin; relationships.
3. At least one creation form must have a dropdown/radio button group/checkbox group to attached related resources to it.
3. One of the lists of resources must implement a filtering mechanism in the UI. The filtering must happen at the server, not in the client.
4. Login and register must be implemented to track data for multiple users.
5. Users should only be able to edit/delete their own data.

## Technical Communication

1. You must have an ERD.
2. You must have some low-fidelity wireframes.
3. You must define issue tickets in your Github repository that clearly describes each feature of the application you are building.
4. You must work on branches at all times and the branches must be appropriately named _(i.e. `my_branch` is not a good name)_.
5. You must write quailty Pull Requests that assume that your teammates have zero knowledge about how to test the PR.
