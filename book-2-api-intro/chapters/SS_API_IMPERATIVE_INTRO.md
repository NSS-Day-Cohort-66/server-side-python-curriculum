# Imperative Implementation Intro

## Imperative and Declarative Code

It's time to learn about an important concept in software development. It is crucial that you learn about this now because you will be writing **much more** declarative code, whereas in the client side course, you wrote much more imperative code until you hit React.

Take a few minutes to read the [Imperative vs Declarative Programming â€“ the Difference Explained in Plain English](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/imperative-vs-declarative-programming-difference/) article to learn the basics of the different between the two types of coding.
