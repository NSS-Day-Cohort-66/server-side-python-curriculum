# Changing an Order

Not only are you going to allow customers to cancel an order, you are also going to allow them to modify an existing order if they change their minds.

## Update Function

1. Make sure you have an `update_order` function in your order handler module.
1. Import that function into views package
1. Import function from package into the `request_handler` module
