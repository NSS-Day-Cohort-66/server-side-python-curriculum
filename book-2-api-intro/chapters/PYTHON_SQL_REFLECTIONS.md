# Python and SQL Reflections

## Code Style Approaches

1. If I was asked in an interview what the difference between declarative and imperative code how would I explain it.
2. If I was asked which one was better, what would be my answer?

## `if` Statements

1. Can I construct an `if` statement to make decisions in my code?
2. Do I understand how to use `elif` and `else` in conjunction with `if`?
3. What is the difference between using `==` and `is` / `is not` with an `if` statement?
4. How would I check to see if a dictionary had a key with an `if` statement?

## `for` Loops

1. Can I write a `for` loop to iterate over elements in a list or tuple?

## Functions

1. Am I able to define and call a function in Python?
2. Do I understand the concepts of function arguments and return values?
3. Can I describe the technical difference between a method and a function?
4. What do I need to do to invoke a function that is defined in a different module?

## Modules

1. Can I explain what a Python module is and why it is useful?
2. Do I know how to import and use functions from a module?
3. Which style of coding do I think takes advantage of using more modules - imperative or declarative?

## Packages

1. Do I understand the difference between a module and a package in Python?
2. Can I import and use a package in my Python program?
3. Do I know which file is needed to turn a directory into a package in a Python project?

## Lists

1. Can I create, modify, and access elements in a Python list?
2. Do I understand list comprehensions and how to use them?

## Dictionaries

1. If I was asked in an interview to describe a dictionary, what would I say?
2. Am I able to create and manipulate a dictionary in Python?
3. Do I understand how to access and modify values based on keys in a dictionary?

## Objects

1. Do I know the difference between an object and a dictionary in Python?
2. Do I remember from Book 1 how to create objects in Python?
3. Can I invoke a function that is a member of an object? Is it still called a function in this case?
4. What can an object do that a dictionary can't?
5. Can I describe how I can define all of the properties and method for a custom object I want to use in my project?

## Try/Except

1. Can I explain the purpose of a `try/except` block in Python?

## HTTP Response Codes

1. When a server throws an unexpected exception, which status code should I send to the client in the response?
2. If the client requested a supported resource that doesn't exist, what status code should be part of the response meta-data?
3. If the client did not send all of the required data in the payload of the request, what status code should be part of the response meta-data?
4. If the client tries to perform an action _(GET, POST, PUT, or DELETE)_ that isn't supported by the API, what status code should be part of the response meta-data?

## SQL

1. Can I explain what SQL is and why it is used in software development?
2. Is my SQL the database?

## SELECT Single

1. Am I able to write a basic SQL query to select a single record from a database table?
2. Do I understand how to use SQL to retrieve specific columns from a table?

## SELECT Multiple with JOIN

1. Can I construct a SQL query to join two tables and select multiple records?
2. Do I understand the two most common types of joins (INNER and LEFT) and when to use them?

## Filter with WHERE

1. Am I capable of using the `WHERE` clause to filter records in a SQL query?
2. Do I understand how to combine `WHERE` with other SQL clauses like `AND`, `OR`, and `NOT`?
