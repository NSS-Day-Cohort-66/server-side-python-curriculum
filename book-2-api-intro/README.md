# Book 2 - Building Your Own API

## Introduction to SQL

Before you start building projects that serve as APIs for your client code to interact with, you need to learn the basics of SQL first.

## Introduction to APIs

Now that you have had an introduction to SQL, it's time to combine your nascent understanding of Python and SQL and start building your first APIs. You will explore the Shipping Ships API as a team first, and then break off on your won to build the Kneel Diamonds API.
