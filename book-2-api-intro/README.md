# Book 2 - Building Your Own API

## Introduction to SQL

Before you start building projects that serve as APIs for your client code to interact with, you need to learn the basics of SQL first.

## Introduction to APIs

Now that you have had an introduction to SQL, it's time to combine your nascent understanding of Python and SQL and start building your first APIs. You will explore the Shipping Ships API as a team first, and then break off on your won to build the Kneel Diamonds API.

Once you have completed all of the Core Projects, your job is to do a self-assessment. Click on the link below to see what this book's assessment instructions are. Once complete, reach out to an instructor to review your vocabulary.

## üîê Group Project

Once people complete all of the core material above, groups of 3-4 will be formed to work together on a group project.

| # | Project&nbsp;Name | Description |
|--|--|--|
|1| [Rare Publishing Platform][38] | Your first, large full-stack group project. You will be building an API service with Python, and using SQL to manage the permanent state in your database. |
|2| [Choose Your Own Adventure][39] | You and your teammates can choose the concept, the user stories, the wireframes, the data, and the acceptance criteria for your own API. |

## üß≠ Explorer Chapters

Explorer chapters are optional and give you the opportunity to expand on the Core chapters and the concepts in the book.
