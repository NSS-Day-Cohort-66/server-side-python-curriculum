# Installations for Mac Users

Here's the script to run to get you ready to start python:

```sh
/bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nashville-software-school/bangazon-llc/cohort-56/book-1-kennels/chapters/scripts/mac-installs.sh)"
```

After running this script, if you **do** **not** see a message that says "Success! You are ready to start coding with Python", reach out to an instructor.
To make sure the script was actually successful run `python3 --version` if you do not get a number that starts with 3.9, close the terminal, reopen and try that command again. If it still does not show 3.9 let an instructor know.
