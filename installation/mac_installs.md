# Installations for Mac Users

Here's the script to run to get you ready to start python:

```sh
/bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/NSS-Day-Cohort-66/server-side-python-curriculum/shipping-ships-version/book-2-api-intro/chapters/scripts/mac-installs.sh)"
```

After running this script, if you **do** **not** see a message that says "Success! You are ready to start coding with Python", reach out to an instructor.
To make sure the script was actually successful run `python3 --version` if you do not get a number that starts with 3.9, close the terminal, reopen and try that command again. If it still does not show 3.9 let an instructor know.

3. Choose **Preferences: Open User Settings**
4. Type "python format" in the settings search
5. In the **Editor: Default Formatter** section, choose _Black Formatter_ as the default formatter.
