# Related Name for Elated Mane

You have been hired to produce an API for a national chain of styling salons called **Elated Mane**. There is an existing code base written by other contractors who couldn't finish the job that you will augment to use the POWER OF DJANGO to make the API more sophisticated.

## Getting Started

1. Visit the [template repo](https://github.com/nashville-software-school/elated-mane) page.
1. Click the **Use this template** button.
1. Once you have your new repo, clone it to your machine.
1. Change to the project directory.
1. Run `pipenv shell`.
1. Run `pipenv install`.
1. Create your database and seed it by running `./seed.sh` in the project directory.

You will have 3 stylists (i.e. **Users**) in the database. Get one of their tokens from the database for use in Postman as you work on this project. Authentication is enabled, so you must have a value for the `Authorization` header.

You should also review the [ERD](https://dbdiagram.io/d/63f61559296d97641d82ea03) for the database used in this API.

## Customer Appointments

The first augmentation that the client wants is to see the appointments for each client. Watch the following video for an explanation of related name's usage for this. When finished with the video implement the change yourself.
