# Gamer Rater React Client

Start a new React client project that will interact with the Gamer Rater API over HTTP.

```sh
npx create-react-app gamerraterclient
```

After the project is set up, you can copy the files from the `components/nav` and `components/auth` directories from the Level Up client to have some boilerplate code to start with.

Once those initial files are in place, create a Github repository and make you initial commit and push.
